File formats for proxpop.sh

Template file:
	-> Valid proxychains configuration file.
	-> Must not contain a proxy list, meaning no line can contain:
		-> The "[ProxyList]" identifier
		-> Proxy entries (ex. 123.456.789.098 8080)
Example: see proxychains.template

Resource file:
	-> Specifies resources to grab proxies from
	-> Any text content will be considered a comment unless it follows the format "type URL"
	-> type is one of "http", "socks4", "socks5" (case sensitive)
	-> URL is a valid link pointing to a list of proxy IPs, ports and credentials
		-> Fields must be separated exclusively by a colon or by spaces (i.e. already valid proxychains entries)
			-> Separators can not be mixed (i.e. IP:PORT USER PASS)
		-> Example with colons: 192.157.34.2:8080:jerry:password
Example:
see resource.default

Chain file (only makes sense using dynamic or static chain)
	-> Tells the script how the final proxychain should be laid out
	-> Each line should start with one of "http", "socks4", "socks5" (case sensitive)
		-> lines of this form will be replaces with proxies of the specified type
			-> Optionally, you can provide a number of proxies by appending ":n" to the type, where n=number of proxies to add.
Example: 
# This chain file will tell the script to make a proxy list that will add:
# 4 http proxies, 3 socks5 proxies, then all socks4 proxies, 2 more http proxies then all remaining socks5 proxies
# This will discard all but the first 6 http proxies
# If not enough proxies are available to fill the number specified, then as many proxies will be added as are available
http:4
socks5:3
socks4
http:2
socks5
